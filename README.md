This game was made using Godot Engine 3.0. If you want to make edits to the scenes, you must use that engine as it was written in GD Script.

Once the Engine is installed, you must import this code and that way you can edit the game.

Also, the game only works correctly in Mozilla Firefox. This engine has a problem with Chromium Browsers. Or you could export it as an executable for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
